summary: Power is a multifaceted concept explored in various contexts. It
  encompasses the dynamics of global communication, as seen in McLuhan's global
  village theory, where technology-driven connectivity leads to tribal conflicts
  and struggles for control over information channels. Power also plays a role
  in innovation practices, where strategic thinking, unconventional tools, and
  diverse perspectives are harnessed to create breakthrough ideas and solve
  problems creatively. This theme touches on media, technology, leadership, and
  the future, highlighting its pervasive influence across different domains of
  human interaction and progress.
excerpt: McLuhan's global village concept predicts technology-driven
  connectivity leads to tribal conflicts, not unification. The internet
  exemplifies this with competing groups clashing over truths and values. The
  struggle extends to control over communication channels.
