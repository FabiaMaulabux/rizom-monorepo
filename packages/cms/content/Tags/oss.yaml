summary: OSS, short for open-source software, represents a philosophy of
  collaboration and transparency in software development. This concept extends
  beyond coding to encompass a broader ethos of openness, creativity, and
  digital freedom. It encourages innovation, community-driven projects, and the
  sharing of knowledge. OSS principles are integral to maintaining a diverse,
  user-centric web ecosystem that resists uniformity and corporate dominance. By
  embracing OSS, individuals and organizations contribute to a more accessible,
  adaptable, and resilient digital landscape.
