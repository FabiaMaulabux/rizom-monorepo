summary: Ethics explores moral principles and values in various contexts. In the
  digital age, it examines the ethical implications of technology, global
  connectivity, and online communities. This includes considerations of
  tribalism in social media, power dynamics in communication channels, and the
  need for value pluralism in our interconnected world. Ethics in this context
  also addresses the challenges and responsibilities that arise from
  simultaneous global existence facilitated by technology, as predicted by
  Marshall McLuhan's global village concept.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan's global village concept predicts technology
  connecting the world leads to simultaneous existence and new tribalism. This
  manifests in today's digital landscape with social media echo chambers and
  online communities.
