summary: Funding is a crucial aspect of keeping the web weird and innovative. It
  encompasses support for open-source initiatives, digital fabrication projects,
  and guerrilla-style creativity. This theme emphasizes the importance of
  financial backing for unconventional ideas that challenge the status quo of
  the internet. It encourages investment in diverse, user-driven web ecosystems
  that resist uniformity and corporate control. By supporting funding for these
  initiatives, we can foster a more vibrant, creative, and free internet
  landscape that preserves the web's unique character and potential for
  innovation.
