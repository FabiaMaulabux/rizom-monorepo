  explores themes of internet fragmentation, global connectivity, and the
  preservation of diversity online. This collection delves into concepts like
  ecosystem architecture, McLuhan's global village, and the need for value
  pluralism in our interconnected world. It also advocates for maintaining the
  web's unique and unconventional spirit through open-source principles, digital
  fabrication, and individual empowerment, challenging standardization and
  corporate control.
