  "summary": "DIY embodies the spirit of hands-on creativity and self-reliance. It encourages individuals to take matters into their own hands, creating, modifying, and repairing things independently. This approach fosters innovation, resourcefulness, and a sense of accomplishment. In the digital realm, DIY extends to web development, open-source contributions, and digital fabrication. It champions the idea of keeping the web weird, promoting diversity, unconventional thinking, and resisting uniformity. DIY culture empowers people to explore their creativity, learn new skills, and contribute to a more vibrant, user-driven ecosystem both online and offline.",
