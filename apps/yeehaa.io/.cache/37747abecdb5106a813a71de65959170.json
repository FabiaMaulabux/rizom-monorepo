  "description": "The article discusses ecosystem architecture, a practice of designing virtual spaces based on shared values. It emphasizes bottom-up, decentralized approaches over traditional top-down planning. The process involves four movements: align, validate, scale, and spin out. The article explores the balance between conformity and innovation, drawing parallels with cellular automata and generative art.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture designs virtual spaces driven by shared values. It employs bottom-up approaches, focusing on emergence rather than strict planning. The process involves aligning vision, validating commitment, scaling efforts, and ultimately letting the ecosystem thrive independently.",
