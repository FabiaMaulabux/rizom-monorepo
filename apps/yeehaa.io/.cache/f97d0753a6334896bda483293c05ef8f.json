  "summary": "Biomimicry is an innovative approach to design and problem-solving that draws inspiration from nature's time-tested patterns and strategies. This concept is closely related to regenerative design and sustainability, emphasizing the importance of learning from and collaborating with natural ecosystems. By observing and emulating nature's efficient and resilient systems, biomimicry seeks to create sustainable solutions in various fields, from architecture to technology. It challenges traditional views of competition in nature, instead highlighting the collaborative and interconnected aspects of ecosystems. This approach aims to create more resilient, decentralized, and environmentally friendly designs that benefit both human communities and the planet as a whole.",
  "excerpt": "Regenerative design aims to improve environments sustainably. It employs techniques like permaculture and biomimicry, emphasizing collaboration with nature. Modern biology reveals ecosystems work towards optimal health for the whole, challenging classic Darwinian views of competition."
