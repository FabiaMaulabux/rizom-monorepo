  "summary": "Decentralization is a concept that intersects with ideas of fragmentation, excess, and waste in economic and cultural contexts. It challenges traditional notions of scarcity and centralized control, advocating for a more distributed approach. While often associated with blockchain technology, the concept extends beyond digital realms, touching on philosophical ideas about abundance in nature and culture. This perspective encourages a reevaluation of what we consider valuable, even finding worth in what might typically be discarded as garbage.",
