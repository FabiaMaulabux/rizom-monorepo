  "summary": "Waste is a multifaceted concept explored through economic, cultural, and philosophical lenses. It encompasses ideas of excess, fragmentation, and the redefinition of value in modern society. This theme delves into the paradoxes of abundance, the potential and pitfalls of decentralization, and the artistic reframing of discarded materials. It challenges traditional notions of nature, culture, and economic systems, encouraging a critical examination of our relationship with excess and the byproducts of contemporary life.",
  "excerpt": "Decentralization's potential to mitigate fragmentation is overshadowed by cryptocurrency's excess. The article explores the historical context of abundance mindsets, drawing on Benjamin and Bataille's theories, and examines how waste redefines nature and culture."
