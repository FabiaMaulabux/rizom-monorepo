  "summary": "Decentralized refers to systems or networks that operate without a central authority, distributing power and control among multiple participants. In technology and innovation, it often involves peer-to-peer collaboration, open sharing of information, and rapid iteration. This approach challenges traditional models of development and intellectual property, fostering resilience and adaptability in markets and ecosystems. While offering numerous benefits, decentralized systems may also face challenges, such as environmental concerns in the context of accelerated production and electronic waste.",
