  "summary": "Tribe refers to the concept of group identity and conflict in the digital age. It explores how global connectivity, rather than unifying people, often leads to tribal divisions. This idea, rooted in Marshall McLuhan's global village theory, is evident in online interactions where different groups clash over truths, values, and control of communication channels. The notion of tribe in this context highlights the paradox of increased connectivity resulting in fragmentation and power struggles, shaping the dynamics of our interconnected world.",
  "excerpt": "McLuhan's global village concept predicts technology-driven connectivity leads to tribal conflicts, not unification. The internet exemplifies this with competing groups clashing over truths and values. The struggle extends to control over communication channels."
