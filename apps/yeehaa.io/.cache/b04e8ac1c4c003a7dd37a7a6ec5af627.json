  "summary": "Surveillance is a critical topic in the context of digital ecosystems and the future of the internet. It highlights concerns about privacy, data ownership, and the potential misuse of personal information. This concept is closely linked to discussions about decentralization, ecosystem architecture, and the need to shape desirable futures rather than accepting expected ones. It emphasizes the importance of taking action against surveillance capitalism and promoting alignment of needs in technological development.",
