  "summary": "Tabloid represents sensationalism and questionable content in media and education. It's associated with exaggerated, misleading, or fabricated information designed to attract attention rather than provide accurate knowledge. This approach often involves pseudoscience, debunked theories, and misapplied expertise. While it may be used for satirical or humorous purposes, it generally undermines genuine learning and critical thinking. The tabloid style prioritizes shock value and entertainment over factual accuracy and educational value.",
  "excerpt": "The Waste Education course satirically promotes counterproductive practices in education, including citing debunked theories, inventing pseudoscience, and publishing junk content. It serves as a cautionary example of ineffective and potentially harmful educational methods."
