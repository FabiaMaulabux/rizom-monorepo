  "summary": "Architecture, in this context, refers to the design and structure of systems, particularly focusing on ecosystem architecture. It involves creating virtual spaces based on shared values, emphasizing bottom-up, emergent design over traditional top-down planning. This approach balances conformity and innovation, drawing inspiration from concepts like cellular automata and generative art. The process of ecosystem architecture includes four key movements: align, validate, scale, and spin out. This methodology aims to foster community-driven innovation and design that can evolve and thrive independently.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture designs virtual spaces driven by shared values. It emphasizes bottom-up, emergent design over traditional planning. The process involves aligning vision, validating commitment, scaling efforts, and ultimately letting go for the ecosystem to thrive independently."
