  "summary": "Global encompasses themes of worldwide connectivity, technological impact, and cultural shifts. It explores the fragmentation of the internet, comparing it to geological processes and McLuhan's global village concept. The focus is on how digital landscapes evolve, creating diverse ecosystems and tribal conflicts. It examines the struggle for control over communication channels and the resulting power dynamics. The global perspective also encourages preserving internet freedom, fostering innovation, and resisting uniformity through unconventional thinking and open-source principles.",
