  "summary": "Sustainability focuses on creating systems and practices that can be maintained indefinitely without depleting resources or harming the environment. This approach encompasses various techniques like regenerative design, permaculture, and biomimicry, which draw inspiration from nature's efficient and resilient systems. By emphasizing collaboration over competition and aligning with natural processes, sustainability aims to create healthier, more vibrant communities and ecosystems. It challenges traditional views of resource use and encourages innovative solutions for long-term environmental, social, and economic well-being.",
