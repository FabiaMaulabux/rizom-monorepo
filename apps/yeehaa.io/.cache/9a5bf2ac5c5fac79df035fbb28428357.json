  "summary": "Ecosystem represents a holistic approach to designing and understanding interconnected systems, drawing inspiration from nature. It encompasses principles of sustainability, regeneration, and decentralized collaboration. This concept applies to various domains, including digital communities, future planning, and architectural design. Ecosystem thinking promotes adaptability, resilience, and value-driven development. It challenges traditional top-down approaches, favoring bottom-up, emergent processes that allow for innovation and diversity. The ecosystem perspective encourages alignment with natural systems, fostering sustainable practices and vibrant communities across physical and virtual spaces.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture designs virtual spaces driven by shared values. It employs bottom-up approaches, focusing on emergence rather than strict planning. The process involves aligning vision, validating commitment, scaling efforts, and ultimately letting the ecosystem thrive independently."
