  "summary": "Tech encompasses the evolving landscape of digital innovation and technological advancements. It explores concepts like ecosystem architecture, which views digital networks as complex, distributed systems transcending traditional boundaries. The focus is on modern, decentralized organizations and the fragmentation of the internet, comparing it to geological processes. This area embraces diversity in digital landscapes, considering it an opportunity for innovation rather than a problem to solve. It challenges conventional frameworks and proposes interdisciplinary solutions for thriving in the rapidly changing technological environment.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture emerges as a new approach to designing decentralized organizations in the digital age. It views internet fragmentation as an opportunity for innovation, embracing diversity in digital landscapes rather than attempting to restore a singular global network."
