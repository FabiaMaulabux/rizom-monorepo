  "summary": "Decentralized refers to systems, networks, or approaches that distribute power, control, and decision-making across multiple entities rather than concentrating them in a single central authority. This concept is applied in various contexts, including technology, governance, and innovation. It emphasizes peer-to-peer collaboration, open sharing, and the creation of diverse ecosystems that align with shared values. Decentralization aims to challenge traditional models of centralized control, fostering resilience, adaptability, and user empowerment while addressing concerns about surveillance and misaligned interests in digital spaces.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture encourages investing in desirable futures rather than accepting expected ones. The decentralized internet's promise was the multiplication of public and private spaces with unprecedented ownership. We must align interests before connecting the unconnected to prevent a surveillance capitalism future."
