  bio: >
    
    I am an entrepreneur, thinker, and coder. Nowadays, I like to call myself an
    ecosystem architect. Concretely, this means that I bring people together
    around common values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into
    effective ecosystems.


    My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn, and
    challenging preconceived and ill-informed notions of educational
    institutions. With Offcourse, I aim to create an ecosystem of people and
    tools that focus on open and transparent knowledge sharing instead of
    credentials, ego, and intellectual property.


    In 2021, I created the Superconnectors event format that enabled startups to
    present their so-called 'critical ask' to the best-connected people of the
    global tech ecosystem. 


    I holds a PhD in Philosophy from the university of Utrecht and worked as a
    researcher and teacher at several traditional (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam,
    Minneapolis) and non-traditional (DevBootcamp San Francisco) schools. I also
    founded the Innovator's Working Group of the Dutch Internet Society, and was
    actively involved in the Public Spaces Coalition. I strongly advocate for
    impactful and inclusive internet.


    I currently work and live in Taipei, Taiwan.
description: 'The sequence promotes "Waste Education" by encouraging
  counterproductive practices: citing debunked theories, inventing
  pseudoscience, misapplying expertise, and publishing junk content. These steps
  effectively waste time and resources, misleading learners and hindering
  genuine educational progress. This approach demonstrates how not to conduct
  proper education, serving as a cautionary example of ineffective and
  potentially harmful educational methods.'

    description: The article critiques the term "pseudoscience," arguing it's
      unhelpful for waste education. By understanding this perspective, one can
      invent more convincing pseudoscientific claims that avoid obvious red
      flags. This knowledge aids in creating persuasive misinformation about
      waste management, potentially hindering genuine environmental efforts.

    description: This video misleadingly applies waste management expertise to
      promote improper disposal methods. It humorously demonstrates how misusing
      knowledge can lead to environmental harm, ironically highlighting the
      importance of proper waste education and responsible practices.

    description: Weekly World News satirizes tabloid journalism, showcasing absurd
      headlines and stories. This exaggeration of sensationalism educates
      readers about recognizing and avoiding misinformation, aligning with the
      goal of waste education by highlighting the "junk" nature of such content.
      It serves as a humorous tool for critical thinking and media literacy.
