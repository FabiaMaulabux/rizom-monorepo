summary: The 'Ecosystem Architecture' series explores the evolution of
  ecosystems from biology to digital realms. It discusses internet
  fragmentation, decentralized systems, and regenerative design principles. The
  series examines concepts like Sloterdijk's 'foam' metaphor and McLuhan's
  'global village' to understand modern digital landscapes. It proposes
  ecosystem architecture as an approach to design thriving decentralized
  organizations, addressing global challenges while fostering sustainable
  communities and innovation that benefits both people and planet.
excerpt: Ecosystem architecture combines decentralized systems with regenerative
  design to address global challenges. It reimagines digital landscapes as
  complex systems, embracing diversity and fragmentation as opportunities for
  innovation. This approach fosters sustainable communities and shared
  knowledge, prioritizing collective well-being.
