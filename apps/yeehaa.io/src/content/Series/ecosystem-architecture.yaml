summary: The 'Ecosystem Architecture' series explores the evolution of
  ecosystems from biology to digital realms. It discusses decentralization,
  fragmentation, and regenerative design principles. The series examines
  concepts like McLuhan's global village, Sloterdijk's foam metaphor, and
  Shenzhen's shanzhai ecosystem. It advocates for embracing complexity,
  diversity, and interconnectedness in digital spaces, while addressing
  challenges of sustainability and innovation. The articles propose ecosystem
  architecture as a new approach to designing thriving decentralized
  organizations and communities.
