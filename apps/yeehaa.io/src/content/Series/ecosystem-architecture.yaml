summary: The 'Ecosystem Architecture' series explores the evolution of
  ecosystems from biological concepts to digital landscapes. It discusses
  decentralization, fragmentation, and regenerative design principles. The
  series examines how these ideas apply to internet culture, innovation, and
  societal structures. It emphasizes embracing complexity, fostering
  sustainability, and rethinking traditional notions of scarcity and
  universality. The articles draw from diverse fields, including philosophy,
  technology, and nature, to propose new approaches for creating resilient,
  adaptive systems in our interconnected world.
