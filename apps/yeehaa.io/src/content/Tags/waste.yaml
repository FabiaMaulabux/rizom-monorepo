summary: Waste is a concept that intersects with economic theories, cultural
  practices, and environmental concerns. It challenges traditional notions of
  value and consumption in modern capitalism. This theme explores how waste can
  be reframed as central to nature and culture, offering insights into
  abundance, decentralization, and the shifting paradigms of scarcity and
  excess. It prompts reflection on sustainable practices and the reevaluation of
  what society deems disposable or valuable.
excerpt: Decentralization's cultural techniques can mitigate fragmentation's
  negative effects. However, cryptocurrency's focus on instant wealth
  overshadows blockchain's potential. The article explores how excess and
  abundance shape modern capitalism, challenging traditional economic views.
