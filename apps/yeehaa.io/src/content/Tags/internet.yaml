summary: Internet encompasses the vast digital landscape that connects people,
  information, and technologies globally. This concept explores the complexities
  of online spaces, digital culture, and the impact of interconnectedness on
  society. It delves into philosophical perspectives, such as Peter Sloterdijk's
  'foam' metaphor, to understand the fragmentation and multiplicity of modern
  digital life. The internet's influence extends to various domains, including
  communication, information sharing, and the formation of online communities,
  shaping how we interact, learn, and perceive the world around us.
excerpt: Sloterdijk's foam metaphor offers a framework for understanding our
  complex world. The internet, with its myriad websites and communities,
  resembles foam. Each digital space functions as a bubble - self-contained yet
  linked to others.
