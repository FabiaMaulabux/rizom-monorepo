summary: Sustainability focuses on creating systems and practices that meet
  present needs without compromising future generations. It encompasses
  environmental stewardship, economic viability, and social equity. This concept
  is explored through ecosystem architecture, which emphasizes collaboration in
  natural systems as a model for human societies. Regenerative design principles
  like permaculture and biomimicry are key aspects, encouraging alignment with
  nature to develop sustainable, adaptive, and self-renewing systems across
  various domains. By adopting these principles, we can foster resilient
  communities and rethink our relationship with the environment and each other.
