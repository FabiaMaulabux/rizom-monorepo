summary: Sim represents simulation in various contexts. It's associated with a
  course on "Set Rules" that explores the creation and implementation of rule
  systems. The concept encompasses dissecting living systems, engineering
  digital patterns, and transforming values into rules. It involves simulating
  ecosystems, debugging rule systems, and ultimately allowing established rules
  to govern autonomously. This approach fosters a comprehensive understanding of
  rule creation and maintenance across different domains, blending elements of
  biology, digital design, and system control.
