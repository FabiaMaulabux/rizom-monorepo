summary: Gongkai represents a concept of open sharing in technology,
  particularly associated with the shanzhai ecosystem in Shenzhen. It embodies a
  decentralized approach to innovation that challenges traditional Western
  notions of intellectual property. This model fosters rapid iteration,
  peer-to-peer collaboration, and market resilience. While gongkai drives
  technological advancement and adaptability, it also raises concerns about
  environmental sustainability due to accelerated production and electronic
  waste. The concept is central to understanding the unique dynamics of
  Shenzhen's tech industry and its global impact on innovation practices.
excerpt: Shenzhen's shanzhai ecosystem exemplifies decentralized innovation,
  surpassing earlier models like ham radio. It's characterized by rapid
  iteration, peer collaboration, and gongkai (open sharing). While driving
  technological advancement, it faces environmental challenges.
