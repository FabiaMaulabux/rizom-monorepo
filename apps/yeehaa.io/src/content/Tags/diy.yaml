summary: DIY embodies the spirit of hands-on creativity and self-reliance. It
  encourages individuals to take matters into their own hands, creating,
  modifying, and repairing things without professional help. In the digital
  realm, it extends to keeping the web weird and diverse. This approach
  champions open-source principles, digital fabrication, and guerrilla-style
  creativity. It's about fostering innovation, preserving internet freedom, and
  promoting a user-driven ecosystem that resists uniformity and corporate
  control. DIY empowers people to explore, experiment, and express themselves
  freely in both physical and digital spaces.
excerpt: Keep The Web Weird by engaging with ISOC for internet advocacy,
  embracing open-source principles, exploring digital fabrication, adopting
