summary: Migration is a concept that encompasses the movement and adaptation of
  organisms, communities, and ideas across different environments. It reflects
  the dynamic nature of ecosystems, both natural and human-made, including
  digital spaces. This theme explores the importance of freedom to move between
  habitats, the formation of value-based communities, and the emergence of new
  societal structures like network states and startup societies. It emphasizes
  the significance of designing systems that allow for flexibility and choice in
  affiliations, enabling individuals to vote with their feet in response to
  changing conditions.
