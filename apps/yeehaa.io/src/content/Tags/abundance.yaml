summary: Abundance explores the concept of excess and its implications in
  various contexts. It delves into the relationship between decentralization,
  fragmentation, and collaboration, particularly in the realm of blockchain and
  cryptocurrency. This theme challenges traditional economic frameworks,
  emphasizing the importance of embracing waste and reconsidering our approach
  to resources. It also touches on artistic practices that blur the lines
  between nature, culture, and trash, highlighting the interconnected nature of
  these domains.
excerpt: Decentralization's cultural techniques can mitigate fragmentation's
  negative effects. However, blockchain's potential as an immutable ledger is
  overshadowed by cryptocurrency's promise of instant wealth. Critics argue
  decentralization leads to fragmentation, but this overlooks new forms of
  connection and collaboration.
