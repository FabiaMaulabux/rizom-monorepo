summary: Abundance explores the concept of excess and its role in economy,
  culture, and nature. It challenges traditional notions of scarcity and
  efficiency, suggesting that waste and surplus are intrinsic to natural and
  cultural systems. This perspective encourages a reevaluation of our
  relationship with resources, consumption, and value, proposing that embracing
  abundance could lead to new economic models and cultural understandings. It
  intersects with ideas of decentralization, sustainability, and artistic
  reinterpretation of waste.
excerpt: The article explores decentralization, excess, and waste in relation to
  economy and culture. It critiques blockchain's current manifestation and draws

  to nature and culture.
