summary: OSS, short for open-source software, represents a philosophy of
  collaboration and transparency in software development. This concept extends
  beyond just code, encompassing principles of openness, sharing, and
  community-driven innovation. It's closely associated with keeping the web
  diverse, creative, and user-centric. OSS encourages unconventional thinking,
  digital ownership, and resists corporate uniformity. It aligns with maker
  culture, DIY ethics, and global internet advocacy, promoting a weird and
  wonderful web ecosystem that values freedom, creativity, and collective
  progress.
excerpt: Keep The Web Weird by engaging with ISOC for internet advocacy,
  embracing open-source principles, exploring digital fabrication, adopting
  guerrilla-style creativity, and championing digital ownership. These steps
  foster innovation and preserve internet freedom.
