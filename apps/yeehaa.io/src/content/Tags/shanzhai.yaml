summary: Shanzhai refers to a unique ecosystem of decentralized innovation,
  primarily associated with Shenzhen, China. It embodies a collaborative,
  rapid-iteration approach to technology development that challenges traditional
  Western notions of innovation and intellectual property. Characterized by
  gongkai (open sharing) and peer-to-peer collaboration, shanzhai has proven to
  be highly adaptable and resilient in the market. While driving technological
  advancements, this model also raises concerns about environmental
  sustainability due to accelerated production cycles and electronic waste
  generation.
