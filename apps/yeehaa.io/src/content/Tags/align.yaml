  dynamics. It involves harmonizing goals, interests, and efforts among team
  members to create a unified direction. This alignment fosters better
  communication, increases productivity, and enhances overall team performance.

  towards shared objectives, reducing conflicts and misunderstandings. Alignment
  is crucial in building trust, facilitating emergent ideas, and creating an
  inclusive environment where diverse perspectives are valued and integrated
  into the collaborative process.
