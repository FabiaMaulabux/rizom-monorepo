summary: Foam represents a unique perspective on digital landscapes,
  particularly in the context of internet fragmentation. Inspired by Peter
  Sloterdijk's concept, it reframes the online world as a vibrant,
  interconnected network of bubbles rather than a fractured space. This
  viewpoint celebrates the diversity of the internet, turning perceived
  challenges into opportunities for growth and connection. It encourages us to
  embrace the multifaceted nature of our digital experiences, fostering a more
  positive outlook on the evolving web ecosystem.
