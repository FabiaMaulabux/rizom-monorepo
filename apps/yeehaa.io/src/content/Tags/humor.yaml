summary: Humor is a playful approach to learning that uses wit, irony, and
  satire to engage and entertain. In this context, it's applied to waste
  education, turning the serious topic on its head. By promoting
  counterproductive practices and pseudoscience, it cleverly demonstrates what
  not to do, serving as a cautionary tale. This unconventional method highlights
  the importance of critical thinking and proper educational practices, using
  laughter as a tool for deeper understanding.
