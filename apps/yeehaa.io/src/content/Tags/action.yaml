summary: This concept encompasses the process of establishing and implementing
  rules within systems. It involves analyzing living systems, creating digital
  patterns, and translating values into actionable guidelines. The approach
  includes simulating ecosystems, debugging rule systems, and ultimately
  allowing the established rules to operate autonomously. This methodology is
  applicable across various domains, fostering a deep understanding of rule
  creation, implementation, and maintenance. It emphasizes the importance of
  design, control, and trust in developing effective rule-based systems.
excerpt: Set Rules explores the journey of creating and implementing rule
  systems. It involves analyzing living systems, designing digital patterns, and
  transforming values into actionable guidelines. The process includes
