summary: Decentralization is a concept that intersects with ideas of
  fragmentation, excess, and waste in economic and cultural contexts. It
  challenges traditional notions of scarcity and centralized control, advocating
  for a more distributed approach. While often associated with blockchain
  technology, the concept extends beyond digital realms, touching on
  philosophical ideas about abundance in nature and culture. This perspective
  encourages a reevaluation of what we consider valuable, even finding worth in
  what might typically be discarded as garbage.
excerpt: The article explores decentralization, excess, and waste in relation to
