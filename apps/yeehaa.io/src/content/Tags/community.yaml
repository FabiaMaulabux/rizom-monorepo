summary: Community is a central theme in discussions about ecosystems, digital
  spaces, and societal structures. It encompasses the idea of interconnected
  groups that allow for freedom of movement, fostering innovation and diverse
  values. This concept extends from natural habitats to online platforms and
  even to reimagined forms of governance like network states. The emphasis on
  community highlights its role in facilitating creativity, alignment, and the
  evolution of social structures in our increasingly digital world.
excerpt: Ecosystems facilitate voting with your feet, allowing movement between
  habitats. This principle applies to nature and digital communities, fostering
