summary: This collection explores the concept of shaping and envisioning future
  landscapes, particularly in digital and societal contexts. It covers ecosystem
  architecture, decentralized systems, and regenerative design principles as
  approaches to address global challenges. The resources discuss the evolution
  of interconnected networks, the fragmentation of the internet, and the
  importance of aligning interests in technological development. They emphasize
  critical thinking, practice-based innovation, and the creation of sustainable,
  value-driven digital ecosystems to reclaim and actively shape desirable
  futures.
excerpt: Ecosystem architecture combines decentralized systems with regenerative
  design to tackle global issues, reimagining innovation for both humanity and
  nature. It fosters sustainable communities, shared knowledge, and prioritizes
  collective well-being in shaping our future.
