summary: Ethics explores moral principles and values in various contexts,
  including technology and global communication. It examines the ethical
  implications of our interconnected world, addressing issues like digital
  tribalism, social media echo chambers, and the complexities of online
  relationships. This area of study encourages critical thinking about the
  responsibilities and consequences of our actions in both physical and digital
  realms, promoting value pluralism and ethical decision-making in an
  increasingly connected global society.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan's global village concept predicts technology
  connecting the world leads to simultaneous existence and new tribalism. This
  manifests in today's digital landscape with social media echo chambers and
  online communities.
