summary: Surveillance is a critical topic in the context of digital ecosystems
  and the future of the internet. It encompasses concerns about privacy, data
  collection, and the potential misuse of information by corporations and
  governments. This concept is closely tied to discussions about
  decentralization, ecosystem architecture, and the need to create digital
  spaces that prioritize user interests and shared values over surveillance
  capitalism.
excerpt: Ecosystem architecture encourages investing in desirable futures rather
  than accepting expected ones. The decentralized internet's promise was the
  multiplication of public and private spaces with unprecedented ownership.
