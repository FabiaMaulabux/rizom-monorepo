summary: Ecosystem represents a holistic approach to designing and understanding
  interconnected systems, drawing inspiration from nature. It encompasses
  principles of sustainability, regeneration, and decentralized collaboration.
  This concept applies to various domains, including digital communities, future
  planning, and architectural design. Ecosystem thinking promotes adaptability,
  resilience, and value-driven development. It challenges traditional top-down
  approaches, favoring bottom-up, emergent processes that allow for innovation
  and diversity. The ecosystem perspective encourages alignment with natural
  systems, fostering sustainable practices and vibrant communities across
  physical and virtual spaces.
excerpt: Ecosystem architecture designs virtual spaces driven by shared values.
  It employs bottom-up approaches, focusing on emergence rather than strict
  planning. The process involves aligning vision, validating commitment, scaling
  efforts, and ultimately letting the ecosystem thrive independently.
