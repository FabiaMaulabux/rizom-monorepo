summary: Ecosystem explores the interconnected systems in nature and society,
  emphasizing collaboration, sustainability, and adaptability. It covers
  principles of regenerative design, biomimicry, and permaculture, applying
  these concepts to both natural and digital environments. The ecosystem
  approach promotes decentralized, value-driven communities that allow for
  innovation and freedom of movement. It challenges traditional top-down
  structures, advocating for bottom-up, emergent systems that foster resilience
  and creativity across various domains, from environmental sustainability to
  digital societies and virtual spaces.
