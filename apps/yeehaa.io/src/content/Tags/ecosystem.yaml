summary: Ecosystem explores the interconnected nature of systems, drawing
  inspiration from natural processes to create sustainable, adaptive, and
  self-renewing structures in various domains. It emphasizes collaboration,
  decentralization, and shared values in designing digital and physical spaces.
  This concept challenges traditional top-down approaches, advocating for
  bottom-up, emergent solutions that foster innovation, community building, and
  value pluralism. Ecosystem architecture encourages the freedom to move between
  different communities, promoting creativity and resilience. It also addresses
  the future of the internet, warning against surveillance capitalism and
  promoting decentralized alternatives that align user interests with broader
  societal goals.
excerpt: Ecosystem architecture designs spaces based on shared values,
