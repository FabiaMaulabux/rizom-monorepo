summary: Ecosystem refers to the interconnected network of living organisms and
  their physical environment, functioning as a cohesive unit. In technology and
  business contexts, it often describes the complex system of interdependent
  companies, products, and services that work together to create value. This
  concept emphasizes the importance of understanding relationships,
  interactions, and dependencies within a given environment, whether natural or
  artificial. Exploring ecosystem dynamics can provide insights into
  sustainability, innovation, and adaptation across various fields.
