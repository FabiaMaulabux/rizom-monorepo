summary: Rebel embodies the spirit of unconventional thinking and action in the
  digital realm. It encourages users to challenge the status quo, embrace
  creativity, and maintain the web's unique character. This concept is closely
  tied to keeping the internet weird, diverse, and free from excessive
  standardization. It promotes open-source principles, digital fabrication,
  guerrilla-style creativity, and digital ownership. By adopting a rebel
  mindset, individuals can contribute to an innovative, empowering, and
  distinctively quirky online environment that resists corporate control and
  homogenization.
