summary: Media explores the impact of communication technologies on society,
  particularly focusing on Marshall McLuhan's global village concept. It
  examines how digital connectivity, rather than unifying the world, often leads
  to tribal conflicts and power struggles. This theme delves into the
  complexities of modern information exchange, including internet fragmentation,
  competing narratives, and the battle for control over communication channels.
  It highlights the paradoxical nature of our interconnected world, where
  increased connectivity can amplify divisions and reshape social dynamics.
excerpt: McLuhan's global village concept predicts technology-driven
  connectivity leads to tribal conflicts, not unification. The internet
  exemplifies this with competing groups clashing over truths and values. The
  struggle extends to control over communication channels.
