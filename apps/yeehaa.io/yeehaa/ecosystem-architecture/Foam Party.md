Everyday language overflows with conceptual metaphors celebrating wholeness or lamenting its absence: broken hearts, phantom pains, paradise lost. These deeply ingrained sentiments in our communication explain why letting go of universality proves so challenging, both in fact and in principle. Even when we accept the existential reality of living without absolute truth, we often perceive its absence as a loss. Reframing fragmentation positively seems nearly impossible.

This challenge is particularly evident in discussions about the modern internet. [As previously explored(/posts/align-the-misaligned), the attention to 'internet fragmentation' and its effects has risen in recent years, describing the perceived splintering of the global internet into separate, often incompatible systems. This fragmentation manifests in various forms: technological (differing protocols and standards), commercial (platform-specific ecosystems), and political (state-imposed restrictions and regulations). Many view this trend with concern, fearing the loss of a unified, open internet that once promised global connectivity and the free exchange of ideas.

However, just as the history of virtual space mimics that of its physical counterpart, perhaps we should reconsider our approach to this digital fragmentation. Peter Sloterdijk boldly takes on this challenge of reframing fragmentation in the third volume of his Spheres trilogy, "Foams" (1998). He introduces foam as an antipode to metaphors signifying wholeness, unity, and completeness. Foam, a phenomenon celebrating multiplicity, defies notions of universality without negative reference. Sloterdijk writes:

> "The foam metaphor captures the topological allocation of creative and self-securing creations of living space in an image. It not only reminds us of the tight proximity between fragile units, but also of the necessary self-enclosure of each foam cell, even though they can only exist as users of shared separation installations."

The desire to reverse separation often repeats trauma and causes paralysis. Conversely, celebrating multiplicity leads to empowerment and creativity. In this spirit, we should reconsider the term "internet fragmentation." Fragments only have meaning in relation to a supposedly lost whole. Instead, we might adopt Sloterdijk's perspective and call it "internet foaming."

Foam consists of bubbles, which have played a crucial role in the internet's brief history. The 1990s saw the rise of the infamous dot-com bubble, intertwined with the nascent internet landscape. This economic phenomenon, marked by exuberant valuations of internet-based companies, reached its zenith in 2000 before bursting spectacularly. The collapse sent shockwaves across the global economy, ushering in a widespread recession.

In recent years, we've grappled with the concept of filter bubbles. These algorithmic echo chambers curate content based on user behavior, potentially reinforcing existing beliefs and isolating individuals from diverse perspectives. While this tailored digital experience caters to immediate desires, it can impede meaningful connections with others. Popular platforms like Instagram and TikTok have been accused of trapping us in windowless monads.

However, we must question whether filter bubbles are truly a modern or internet-specific problem. Traditional media - television, radio, newspapers, and even librarians - have long been highly selective in their choices. Travel guides like Lonely Planet have funneled Western tourists to the same destinations for decades, and the concept of a literary canon is itself a massive filter bubble. The modern internet didn't invent the economy or politics of information; it intensified their use, multiplied the bubbles, and made their effects more apparent.

Moreover, it's overly simplistic to focus solely on the problems. Filter bubbles aren't merely defined by misinformation and ignorance, but also by shared values. The inhabitants of these ecosystems relate through commonalities. They choose to live in a bubble because it signifies connectedness and solidarity. At their core, bubbles are seeds - potential ecosystems.

Popping filter bubbles would mean discarding their positive aspects along with the negative. Instead, we might choose to remain in the warm, foamy jacuzzi while increasing our awareness of its inherent issues. The most undesirable side effects of filter bubbles are two sides of the same coin:

1. **Entrapment**: Being confined in a bubble where you don't belong. While shared values can provide support and meaning, being trapped in a community with opposing or threatening values can feel like imprisonment.

2. **Solipsism**: Genuinely believing your bubble is the only reality. Excessive devotion to your community's values can blind you to its limitations and problems. Every ecosystem has boundaries, and a bubble beneficial to you might be stifling or harmful to others.

Moving forward, our challenge lies in addressing these issues without reverting to universal values and norms. As soon as we start bursting bubbles - others' or our own - foam reveals its most crucial characteristic: it has no outside. There is no bird's-eye view. The outside of a bubble is another bubble. Once we truly accept this existential fact, we can stop bursting bubbles and begin fostering ecosystems.

In embracing the foam metaphor, we open ourselves to a new perspective on digital spaces and social interactions. Rather than lamenting the loss of a unified whole or attempting to forcibly merge disparate bubbles, we can appreciate the richness and diversity of our foamy reality. This approach doesn't ignore the challenges posed by filter bubbles and echo chambers, but it reframes them as opportunities for growth, connection, and the nurturing of diverse ecosystems.

The internet, viewed through this lens, becomes not a fragmented wasteland but a vibrant, ever-shifting foam of interconnected bubbles. Our task is to navigate this foam with awareness, empathy, and curiosity, recognizing that each bubble we encounter is a world unto itself, with its own values, languages, and norms. By fostering connections between bubbles and encouraging the growth of healthy ecosystems, we can work towards a more nuanced, diverse, and resilient digital landscape.
