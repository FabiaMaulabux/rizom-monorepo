summary: Small refers to a concept in personal growth and development,
  emphasizing the importance of breaking down larger goals into manageable
  steps. It's associated with the idea that significant progress often comes
  from consistent, incremental actions. This approach is particularly relevant
  in the context of unblocking growth, where focusing on small, achievable tasks
  can lead to substantial improvements over time. By incorporating small steps
  into goal-setting and habit formation, individuals can make complex objectives
  more approachable and sustainable.
excerpt: The path to unblocking growth involves setting clear goals, breaking
  them into manageable steps, sharing knowledge, embracing complexity, and
